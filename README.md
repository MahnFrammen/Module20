Credit Risk Analysis Model Report:
---------------------------------------------

Purpose of the Analysis/Model:
	The primary purpose of this Credit Risk Analysis model is to predict the likelihood of default by assessing the credit risk associated with loan applicants. This helps financial institutions make informed decisions about lending, thereby minimizing potential losses and optimizing their risk management strategies.

Model Performance Metrics
- Accuracy: 0.99
- Precision:
-----Class 0 (Non-Defaulter): 1.00
-----Class 1 (Defaulter): 0.84
- Recall:
-----Class 0 (Non-Defaulter): 0.99
-----Class 1 (Defaulter): 0.94
- F1-Score:
-----Class 0 (Non-Defaulter): 1.00
-----Class 1 (Defaulter): 0.89
- Support:
-----Class 0 (Non-Defaulter): 18,765
-----Class 1 (Defaulter): 619

- Summary and Evaluation:
The model had an overall accuracy of 99%, indicating that it correctly classifies 99% of the cases. Some key observations include the Precision for Non-Defaulters (Class 0): 1.00, meaning all predicted non-defaulters are in fact non-defaulters. Precision for Defaulters (Class 1): 0.84, indicating that 84% of the predicted defaulters are actual defaulters.

Recommendation:
This model could be effectively used by a company for credit risk assessment due to its high accuracy and strong performance metrics. It is particularly effective in identifying non-defaulters, which is crucial for minimizing false positives and ensuring that reliable customers are not unfairly denied credit.
